# Balancing Robot

Javascript based architecture for a balancing robot.

Input from an Accelerometer and a Gyroscope fused using a Kalman Filter and a feedback fed into the actuators to keep the robot balanced.

Any Device with a Touch Screen can be used to control the robot with a companion package. See [here](https://github.com/pradhanshrijal/joystick_touch_webpage).
